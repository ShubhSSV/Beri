                <br>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Beri plant is highly valued for its numerous health benefits and medicinal properties. Its fruit is rich in vitamins C and B, antioxidants, and essential minerals such as iron, potassium, and magnesium, which support immunity, improve digestion, and contribute to skin health. Traditional medicine often uses Beri leaves to treat respiratory problems, inflammation, and skin disorders, while the bark and roots have been used to manage ailments like diarrhea and sore throat. The plant's natural compounds are also thought to promote relaxation, aiding in stress relief and sleep improvement.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> The Beri plant typically flowers in late summer, producing fragrant yellow blooms that attract pollinators. Fruit development follows, and by winter or early spring, the plant bears fruit ready for harvest. The exact fruiting season may vary by region and climate, but generally, the peak fruiting period is during the winter months. This timing allows the plant to avoid extreme summer heat, ensuring healthier growth and better fruit yield in moderate temperatures.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> The Beri plant is native to South Asia but has become widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. It is well-suited to dry, arid climates and can often be found growing in India, Pakistan, China, and parts of Africa and the Middle East. The plant's resilience makes it ideal for regions with poor soil quality and limited water, as it is drought-resistant and can thrive in sandy, well-draining soils. Today, the Beri plant is also grown in certain parts of the Americas and Australia, where conditions align with its native habitat.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> The Beri plant is a hardy species with a long lifespan, often reaching an age of 50 to 60 years when properly cared for. It typically begins fruiting after 3â€“5 years, with optimal yields developing as the tree matures. As a slow-growing tree, it benefits from routine pruning and can live for decades, providing consistent fruit harvests and a variety of medicinal uses over its lifetime. Its robust nature also means it is a valuable plant in sustainable agriculture, especially in regions prone to drought or soil degradation.</p>
